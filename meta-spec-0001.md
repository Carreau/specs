# Description

- projects have separate enhancement proposal processes and development contraints
- specs are cross-project recommendations to better coordinate the ecosystem and
  provide a more unified experience for users.

- ep are debated / accepted by the projects themselves often using something
  like consensus
- specs are different in that  

  - we don't expect every spec will be immdediately adopted by all projects
  - some will never be adopted by all projects

- yet for specs to be meaningful they need to be adopted by several projects
- and this adoption has to be approved by those projects independently

  - this means the spec process must be tightly integrated w/ core projects
  - and flexible enough that different projects can implement / adopt according
    to their specific constraints and schedules

## Steering Committee

The SPEC Steering Committee (SSC) is composed of representatives from the NumPy,
SciPy, Matplotlib, pandas, statsmodels, scikit-image, scikit-learn, and
NetworkX projects as well as two general community members.


the SSC is responsiblities include

- maintain and approve specs including the process specs
  - metaspecs vs specs
  - it is up to each project to decide how they will determine whether their
    project adopts a spec or not

- serve as a communication channel to and from their projects

- accept new projects to provide members to the spec steering committtee

## Contributors

who can submit a new SPEC?

Any community member can propose a new SPEC by following the procedure...

Contributors should read our [Code of Conduct]({{< ref
"/about/code_of_conduct.md" >}}).

# Implementation

## Membership

- how are members selected?  do they have term limits?

- how is the list of members expanded?

## MetaSPEC

- consensus of SSC 

## SPEC

for projects that already have an ep process in place, we recommend they
create a new ep to list the specs they have adopted including links to their
project discussions leading to adoption.

they should also add their project to the spec_adopted_by tag for the spec.
